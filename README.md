This repository contains the source code for a calculator implemented using JavaScript. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as additional functionalities like square root, reciprocal, and percentage calculations.

## Features

- **Button Press Simulation**: The code includes a function called `buttonPressedVisual` that simulates the pressing of a button by modifying its visual appearance.

- **Valid Key Check**: The `valid` function checks whether a pressed key corresponds to a valid calculator button.

- **Digit Addition**: The `addDigit` function handles the addition of digits to the input string.

- **Backspace Functionality**: The `backspc` function implements the backspace functionality by removing the last character from the input string.

- **Output Fixing**: The `fixOut` function shortens the output string displayed on the screen to show the latest data.

- **Calculation Logic**: The code contains various functions for performing calculations based on different operations.

- **Clearing and Resetting**: The code includes functions for clearing the entry, clearing all data (except memory), and resetting the calculator to its initial state.

## Usage
